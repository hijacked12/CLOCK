# CLOCK
1. Basic Functions: 
To design multifunctional digital clock application with functions below:
(1) Display the date (year, month and day) on the clock. 
(2) Display the time (hours, minutes and seconds) on the clock. 
(3) Set the alarm time. 
(4) Pop up a message dialog box when the alarm clock goes off. 
2. Advanced Functions: 
(1) Play music when the alarm clock goes off. 
(2) Add turn on/off switch for the alarm clock and indicate the status on the clock.
(3) Add snooze function for the alarm clock. 
(4) Add a countdown meter in the clock. 
(5) Add a stopwatch in the clock. 

In this experiment our goals was to make multi function clock.
Doing this experiment, we have to use :

1. one panel 
2. put inside that panel: two J panelone for a simple clock with date, month, year and another one for alarm.
3. The day, month and year will be just a Jtext field 
4. The alarm part we will have 3 J text file for hour,min,sec.
5. One J button for setting alarm and another J button for removing alarm.
